git init- This command initializes the git in the given path. You can see the .git hidden files after this command gets executed.

git remote add origin [gitLink]- gitLink denote the place where your code is stored in the remote repository

git add .- Add all the files in the local directory to the remote repository

git commit -m "First commit"- It establishes a connection with local repository

git push origin master- It establishes a connection with a remote repository and upload your source code or files to GitHub

Note: If you get fatal: remote origin already exists which means the connection is already established.


You could also disable use of the Git credential cache using git config --global --unset credential.helper.
Then reset this, and you would continue to have the cached credentials available for other repositories (if any). 
You may also need to do git config --system --unset credential.helper if this has been set in the system configuration
 file (for example, Git for Windows 2).
git config --global credential.helper manager
